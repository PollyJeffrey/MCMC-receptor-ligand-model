# MCMC-receptor-ligand-model

A repository for some python codes to implement the Metropolis-hastings algorithm for MCMC.

The file Data_generation.py generates synthetic data based on a receptor ligand binding model. The file MCMC.py then implements the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to infer the parameters of the model.
