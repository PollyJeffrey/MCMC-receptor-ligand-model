# MCMC-receptor-ligand-model

A repository for some python codes to implement the Metropolis-hastings algorithm for MCMC. There are two folders, one in which the MCMC is implemented for estimation of only one parameter and the other in which the MCMC is implemented to estimate two parameters.

The file Data_generation.py generates synthetic data based on a receptor ligand binding model. The file MCMC.py then implements the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to infer the parameters of the model.
